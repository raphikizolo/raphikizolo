- 👋 Hi, I’m @raphikizolo
- 👀 I’m interested in building cool stuff with code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and django while creating a simple decorator-based application context like the annotation-based one in spring.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything written in Java, Kotlin, Python and C#.
- 📫 How to reach me: raphaelmwasaru@[gmail|yahoo|outlook].com
- ⚡ Fun fact about me: I love Java, but my curly braces take new lines. It's probably because C# was my first.
