- 👋 Hi, I’m @raphikizolo
- 👀 I’m interested in building seamlessly working stuff with code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning django and backend python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything written in Java, Kotlin, Python and C#.
- 📫 How to reach me: raphikizolo on twitter.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Java, but my curly braces take new lines. It's probably because C# was my first.
